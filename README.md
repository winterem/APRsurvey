# APRsurvey

This is a replication package for the article 'How do developers really feel about bug fixing? Directions for automatic program repair'. The survey questions can be found here and we encourage the survey's re-use.

We also include survey data (with demographic data and qualitative responses removed).

This is part of the Fixie Project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (grant number EP/S005730/1). The project team are: David Bowes, Tracy Hall, Vesna Nowack, Emily Winter (Lancaster University); Steve Counsell (Brunel University London); Saemundur Haraldsson (University of Stirling); and John Woodward (Queen Mary University of London). If you have any questions about re-use of this survey, feel free to contact Emily at e.winter@lancaster.ac.uk.
